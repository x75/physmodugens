A set of UGens implementing various physically inspired
synthesis models. These are all taken from R. W. Berry:
EXPERIMENTS IN COMPUTER CONTROLLED ACOUSTIC MODELLING (A STEP
BACKWARDS ??), ICMC Proceedings 1988, available from
http://www.ron-berry.co.uk/RBacmodelling.pdf

Winter 2007/08 Oswald Berthold

The full package should eventually contain 
 - Band-pass Filter
 - Filterbank and Vocoder
 - Waveguide models
 - Room simulation
 - FoF

but as most of it needs more work, there's only the Waveguide
models included.

To build on Linux:
 - extract the X75PhysMod.tar.gz file on the same level as our
   SuperCollider source directory
 - cd X75PhysMod
 - scons install

To build on OSX:
pretty much same as above, scons should get you there
